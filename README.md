# Study-Hour-Prediction

## INTRODUCTION:-

The dataset consists of Study hours and the scores of the students. Here we have predicted the study hours through Simple Linear regression model.
## What is Regression?
Regression analysis is a statistical modelling technique that we use to estimate relationship between a dependent variable (output/target variable) and one or more independent variables (predictors/features).
Here, we took Hours as independent variable and Scores as dependent variable.

## REQUIRED TO IMPORT:-

Here we have import pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, LnearRegression

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

## VISUALISATION:-

For visualisation we have ploted the linear regression line and scattered points.
